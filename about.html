<p>Third person is a bit vain here, I won't bother. I'm a software developer working in London, currently as Technical Architect for <a href="http://www.snowvalley.com" title="Visit the Snow Valley site">these folk</a> (see disclaimer in footer!) I work mainly with .NET tech there, but outside of work I play around with various things, with a liking for Erlang, Ruby, Lisp, Haskell, Io &mdash; whatever piques my interest.</p>

<p>Happily I don't just code, I'm in to most of the normal things - music, films, drinking, more music, living by the seaside. Anyway &mdash; if you want to get in touch there's plenty of ways of doing so and they're all linked somewhere on this site.</p>
