Last week I was lucky enough to be at LambdaConf 2015 in Boulder, CO. While there I gave a workshop on [Freya][freya] which was fun (for me at least, hopefully for the attendees). I've got a few blog posts percolating from my experiences (mainly about how LambdaConf made me feel about the good and the bad of the current F# world), but to start the mental process actually running:

First of all, if you can get to LambdaConf 2016 - *go*. The conference is fantastic -- thought provoking, challenging, friendly, and run really well by a small and very hard-working team. There's always something worth seeing at any particular point, from the really technical and mathematical to the more human and psychological. The mix is excellent, and I'd love to go back next year and find an even bigger programme.

Secondly, my thanks to everyone there -- everyone was friendly and enthusiastic and if more conferences were this good, the software and FP worlds would be a nicer place.

Finally, and the only downside -- a big "screw you" to British Airways for being generally shoddy and rude. If I head back over for LambdaConf 2016 I'll be attempting to avoid BA entirely, even if it means indirect flights. Maybe I'll stop off somewhere else I love first -- Chicago might be a nice detour...
