title:  "Aether &mdash; Total &amp; Partial Lenses for F#"
categories: fsharp aether
---

I spent a little time recently looking deeper at lenses in F# (I use them quite commonly). There's an implementation available as part of [FSharpx][fsharpx-lens], but I decided to see whether it might be nicer to have a single purpose lens library, with a few extra features as a goal.

Firstly, the ability for other libraries to provide over their own types for external consumers, without requiring a dependency on the lens library (the FSharpx implementation requires lenses to be a specific record type, meaning a dependency on FSharpx). Secondly, a clear distinction between total and partial lenses (lenses which definitely return a value from the getter, and lenses which *may* return a value from the getter &mdash; in this case an F# option).

I also took a chance to look around at other lens libs, and settled on a naming pattern and convention taken from the [data-lens][data-lens] library in Haskell.

I'll be doing a full introduction shortly, but for now, the library is called __Aether__ and it's over on my __Xyncro__ GitHub org [here][aether], along with installation instructions. It's __MIT__ licensed.

In the meantime, here's an illustrative snippet...

{% highlight fsharp linenos=table %}

type A =
    { One: B 
      Two: B option }

    // A total lens to One
    static member oneLens =
        (fun x -> x.One), (fun o x -> { x with A.One = o })

    // A partial lens to Two
    static member twoPLens =
        (fun x -> x.Two), (fun t x -> { x with A.Two = Some t })

and B =
    { One: string
      Two: string option }

    static member oneLens =
        (fun x -> x.One), (fun o x -> { x with B.One = o })

    static member twoPLens =
        (fun x -> x.Two), (fun t x -> { x with B.Two = Some t })

// A total lens to the value of "One" in the nested B
let testLens = A.oneLens >--> B.oneLens

// A partial lens to the value of "One" in the nested B option
let testPLens = A.twoPLens >?-> B.oneLens

// A function which will return the value of One in the nested B from a,
// an instance of A (a string)
// (could also be written "getL testLens")
let getOne a = testLens ^. a

// A function which will return the value of One in the nested B option from a,
// an instance of A (a string option)
// (could also be written "getPL testLens")
let getOneMaybe a = testPLens ^?. a

// A function will set the value of One within an instance of A to x (a string)
// (could also be written "setPL testLens") 
let setOne x a = (testPLens ^?= x) a
