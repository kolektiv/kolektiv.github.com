It's been almost a year since I last did anything conference-y, so it must be time for another! So, I'm happy to say I'll be speaking at [F# Exchange 2016][fsharpx] on April 15th. To sweeten the deal rather massively, there'll also be lots of other speakers, so you can safely avoid me...

This year I'll be trying something a bit different with my talk. I've usually focused pretty heavily on a single project or principle when I'm talking but this time I'm going to aim for a bit of a magical mystery tour. When I started building what is now [Freya][freya], it was just a standalone set of types and functions, but while building it I discovered that a lot of what was needed could be built more elegantly and more effectively by implementing some new abstractions (or at least implementing them in ways that didn't exist in F# before). Along the way I've ended up writing [Aether][aether], [Anat][anat], [Arachne][arachne], [Chiron][chiron], [Hekate][hekate], and [Hephaestus][hephaestus] and they've changed the way I think about writing software and designing programs.

I'll try and share that journey a bit -- and maybe spark some discussions. If you're at F# Exchange 2016, it'd be great to chat -- come and find me :)
