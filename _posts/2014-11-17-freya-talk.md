title: Notice &mdash; Freya Talk for Functional Londoners
categories: fsharp freya

Just a rather brief post this one, as lately has been more writing of code than writing of prose (with the exception of some consulting work, which tends towards the verbose). I'll be giving a talk on Freya, a new functional-first web stack (built on the [OWIN][owin] standard) to [Functional Londoners][fl] on December 11th. A little more information and an RSVP option is over at [Meetup][meetup]. It's a welcoming and friendly group to meet up with in general regardless of my rambling this time, so do come along.
